# Registro de ciudades

## About our project (purpose)
Nuestro proyecto consiste en un programa sencillo, desarrollado enteramente con Python, cuyo prop√≥sito principal es funcionar como un directorio de diferentes ciudades del mundo. 

Welcome to our city register!

Our program (fully developed using Python) works as a practical register that stores information from multiple international cities.

You can easily access a practical list with different information points about the city of your choice. You will be able to check out data such as population, country in which the city is located and its zip code.

If you wish, you can also add a new city to the register!
After adding some basic, simple facts about your favorite city, it will be displayed in the main registry of our app. 

As an advanced feature, we have added an "advanced search" feature to our project. You simply have to type in a basic fact (name, country or zip code) about the city you want to find relevant information on, and our program does the rest. You will get  a list with everything you want to know about said city!
